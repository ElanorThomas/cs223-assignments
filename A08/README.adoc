= Hardware specifications

I ran my tests on goldengate, hoping for more
consistentcy and higher performance overall.

Total memory on goldengate is listed as 95315 (GB), but only 86729 are available.
There are 2 sockets and 16 cores per socket, meaning 32 physical cores/processors.
However, 2 threads per core means 64 logical cores.
